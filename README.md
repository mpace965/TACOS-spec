# TACOS-spec
TACOS Framework v1

## Overview
TACOS is a framework for assessing the development practices of open source projects against a set of secure development standards specified by the [NIST Secure Software Delivery Framework (SSDF) V1.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf).

## Attestation
The attestation itself is metadata that contains the history, timestamp and identity of who is making the statements, in addition to the statements themselves.

## Statements
At the heart of TACOS are assertions about open source software development practices at the package level (not per-release at this time). It leverages a model of standards and assessment to provide a piece of metadata in response to that standard. The states of assessment against each objective standard are: True, False, and `NOASSERTION`. In some cases, such as licensing or SDLC Policy URL, it will be useful to include the direct piece of metadata or the evidence URL itself.  

The end product is a machine-readable format that can be referenced in an SBOM, or provided as a standalone report as a complementary artifact to software vendor attestation on their own internal software development practices.

Each attestation has a timestamp associated with it, and assessments and resulting statements are refreshed according to these events:
- A new release of a package has been made
- A new release of one of a package’s dependencies has been made
- A new vulnerability is logged
- Periodic, timestamped cadence for manually validated data, such as verified income streams and [early signal that a package may be on a path to being abandoned](https://blog.tidelift.com/up-to-20-percent-of-your-application-dependencies-may-be-unmaintained)

### NIST SSDF mappings
Each field in this framework maps to the [NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) v1.1](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf). This framework is a continuum of software practices from setting a solid foundation for an organization and clear processes and standards for success, through the actual development work, and to the state where ‘what happens when problems arise’. 

The NIST SSDF v. 1.1 categories are:
 1. **Prepare the organization:** Organizations should ensure that people, processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the organization level.
- IncomeStreams
- 2FA enabled
- LatestStableRelease
- KnownReleasesURL
- PackageStatus
- SDLCPolicyURL
- SDLCEvidenceDataURL

2. **Protecting the software:** Organizations should protect all components of their software from tampering and unauthorized access. 
- SBOM-CycloneDX
- SBOM-SPDX
- BinariesInRepository
- FuzzingPractice
- ReproducibleBuilds
- ReleasesDigitallySigned

3. **Produce well-secured software:** Organizations should leverage people, processes and tools to produce well-secured software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.
- PackageName
- UpstreamRepositoryURL
- CleanReleaseAvailable
- CodeReviewPractice
- PackageSecurityPolicyURL
- PackageSecurityContact

4. **Respond to vulnerabilities:** Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities in their software releases and have process and accountability to respond appropriately to those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.
- CleanReleaseAvailable
- KnownVulnerabilities
- KnownVulnerabilitiesInDependencies
- KnownVulnerabilitiesURL
